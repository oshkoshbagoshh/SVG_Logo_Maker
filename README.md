# SVG_Logo_Maker

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a program in Node JS that would take in user input at the command line,and create a simple SVG image for freelance web developers.  When developing this project, I learned about .svg file types, and how they use properties similar to XML. 

The project also utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals.
